# This online signature verification system used VGG16, a pre trained ML model used to extract deep spatial features along with HOG, a traditional feature extraction algorithm which is used to extract features like strokes, shape etc. Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and used Random Forest classifier for classification. Used Streamlit, a web based user interface integrated with this model to display it online.
